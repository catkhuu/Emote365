Time flies by in a year, often with many upheavals and surprises. Emote365 is a visual calendar of each hour for each day in a year based on Twitter's trends. We utilize the Microsoft Cognitive Services API to run a sentiment analysis on the top trends for each hour, and return an image (via the Getty Images API) that reflects the overall sentiment of those trends. A final image is saved for each day that represents the sentiments for the "trend of the day".

Instead of trying to remember everything that happened in a year, the user can scroll through all 365 images to experience the different emotions that were felt no matter where they went.
